    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>⅔ cup honey, divided</li>
        <li>5 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups whole wheat flour, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix warm water, yeast, and 1/3 cup honey in a large bowl to dissolve. Add 5 cups bread flour, and stir to combine. Let
        sit for 30 minutes, or until big and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Mix in 3 tablespoons melted butter, remaining 1/3 cup honey, and salt. Stir in 2 cups whole wheat flour. Transfer dough
        to a floured work surface and gradually knead in remaining 2 cups whole wheat flour. Knead until dough starts to pull
        away from the work surface, adding more whole wheat flour if necessary; dough should be a bit tacky to the touch, but
        not too sticky.</li>
        <li>Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough. Cover with a dish towel and let rise in a warm
        place until doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Grease three 9x5-inch loaf pans. Punch down the dough, and divide it into 3 loaves. Place in the prepared loaf pans, and
        allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch, another 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake the risen loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 25 to 30 minutes, do not overbake.</li>
        <li>Lightly brush the tops of the loaves with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter when done to prevent crust from getting
        hard. Cool completely.</li>

    </ol>
