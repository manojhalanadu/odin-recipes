    <h2>Golden Harvest Delight: Butternut Squash Cheesecake Spectacular</h2>
    <p>Butternut squash cheesecake is a delectable dessert that combines the rich, creamy texture of cheesecake with the
    comforting flavors of roasted butternut squash. This dessert typically features a smooth and velvety cheesecake filling
    infused with pureed butternut squash, warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, and hints of vanilla. The crust, often made
    with graham crackers or cookies, complements the creamy filling, adding a delightful crunch to every bite. Finished with
    a luscious topping or garnish, this dessert offers a delightful blend of sweetness and autumnal flavors, making it a
    perfect treat for fall gatherings or holiday celebrations.</p>
    <p>This butternut squash cheesecake is genius—it’s lighter, more flavorful, and just as rich and decadent as its pumpkin
    cheesecake cousin. This one is baked Basque cheesecake-style, hot and fast, needs no crust, and will be nicely browned
    on top. It may crack, but really, do we care when it is this creamy and delicious?</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large butternut squash, roasted to yield 1 1/2 cups mashed squash</li>
        <li>16 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Oil a 10-inch springform pan, line with parchment, and set aside.
        Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
        <li>Cut butternut squash into thick crosswise slices, remove seeds, and place on the lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until very soft, about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, separate the flesh from the skin;
        discard skin. Mash squash until smooth, measure out 1 1/2 cups, and set aside to cool completely. Reserve any remaining
        squash for another use.</li>
        <li>Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Add softened cream cheese, sugar, flour, and salt to a bowl, and cream together with a spatula until very smooth.</li>
        <li>Add maple syrup, 1 1/2 cups mashed butternut squash, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Mix with an electric mixer or whisk
        until combined; mix in vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in cream.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared springform pan. Tap the pan lightly on the counter to settle the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is almost fully set, 50 to 60 minutes. The center should wiggle very
        slightly If the pan is shaken back and forth. If the center seems soupy, continue baking for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove and let cool for 5 minutes. Run a thin knife between the outside edge of the cheesecake and the inside of the
        springform ring to release cheesecake from the ring; it will contract as it cools. Let cool 30 minutes more, then remove
        outside ring.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate cheesecake for a few hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>
    </ol>
